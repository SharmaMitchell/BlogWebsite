				<class class="section-title"> The <span>Inspiration</span></class>
				<p>When I was a beginner in Japanese, I would often shy away from participating in "Japanese-only" chatrooms, since there were many words I didn't understand. I didn't want to pester people by asking them what their sentences meant, but I also didn't want to copy+paste dozens of messages into Google Translate so I could follow the conversation. I thought back on these times as I wondered why the "Japanese-only" chat was so inactive in the Discord server for my university's Japanese club, and decided to make a bot to help make the chat more accessible to beginners.</p>
				<class class="section-title">The <span>challenges</span></class>
				<p>I was immediately faced with two challenges: I had never made a discord bot, and I had never used an API. I knew that I needed to use some kind of translation service to process the messages, but I had no idea where to start.</p>
				<p>I did my research on both creating discord bots, and utilizing APIs, and determined that python would serve me well for both of these purposes. I was already familiar with the language, which saved me the trouble of syntax-related confusion. After reading a few Reddit posts, I discovered that creating Discord bots was more accessible that I thought - there were libraries full of Discord-specific functions available in multiple different languages, and incorporating an external API into the mix seemed very approachable. Now that I had my language, and a general idea of how I could implement both a discord bot and a translation function via API, I needed my toolkit. I would need a python library for Discord-specific functions, and a translation API to process translations.</p>
				<class class="section-title">The <span>Tools</span></class>
				<p>After 30 grueling seconds of Googling, I discovered that 'DeepL', a deep-learning powered alternative to Google Translate, had a free API. There was a monthly limit of 500,000 characters, but that would be plenty for me, and later a few dozen active users.</p>
				<p>Another brief stint of research lead me to a replit template for 'Discord.py', a python library which serves as an API wrapper for Discord. With these two tools I had everything that I needed to create my first bot.</p>
				<class class="section-title">The <span>Process</span></class>
				<p>I started by creating a bot via Discord's developer portal. I set up the profile, giving the bot an anime-inspired name - 'Komi', after a character in a show I had been watching, and a play on the word 'communication'. I then gave 'KomiBot' a profile picture to match, and started development.</p>
				<p>Getting started with my bot was surprisingly simple. I set up my development environment in replit, using the previously mentioned 'Discord.py' template. I skimmed the included example functions and referenced the Discord.py documentation for the functions I needed in order to implement my 'translate' function. Between the extensive resources for Discord.py and a few YouTube tutorials on APIs, it wasn't long before I had my translate function up and running, and was able to successfully translate from Japanese to English.</p>
				<p>But what about translating in the other direction?</p>
				<class class="section-title"><span>More</span> Challenges</class>
				<p>I had assumed it would be trivial to implement this feature without adding any unnecessary complication on the user-end. Check for alpha-numeric input using 'isalnum()', and I wouldn't need to waste an API call by checking the language with DeepL. 'if isalnum(text): input_lang = en'. DONE! ... <b>Not quite.</b> </p>
				<p>Thinking that the 'alpha' in 'alpha-numeric', and by extension 'isalnum', was in reference to the alphabet, I had assumed that 'isalnum' would evaluate to <b>false</b> if given Japanese text. But I quickly realized that this was not the case, as my Japanese test messages started coming back the same - since they were being sent to DeepL as English to be translated into Japanese. </p>
				<p>After spending some time on StackOverflow, and deliberating on my options, I decided to implement a check for the input language by using the python function 'isascii()' to determine if the input could be represented by the ascii character set. It wasn't a perfect solution, since emojis and other special characters would cause English input to be sent as Japanese, but it saved me a wasted API call or an additional dependency to check the language, so I figured it was worth the trade-off. Given that the main purpose of the bot is to translate Japanese into English, I'm satisfied with this solution. </p>
				<class class="section-title">The <span>Payoff</span></class>
				<p>With my desired features implemented and my bot up-and-running, it was time to exhibit my bot. I excitedly informed the Japanese server I mentioned above that I had made a discord bot that translates, in hopes to help beginners follow the Japanese-only chat. After receiving approval from the server admins, KomiBot was added to an active server with over 80 members.</p>
				<p>Although it's still too early to judge KomiBot's effectiveness in re-populating the Japanese channel in the server, I'm proud that I was able to create a discord bot despite my lack of experience, and that it's now being used in an active server that I'm a part of.</p>
