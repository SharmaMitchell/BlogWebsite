				<class class="section-title"> The <span>Motivation</span></class>
				<p>
					I've been wanting to build my own portfolio website for quite some time now. It's been on my list of project ideas for almost a year, but I hadn't undertaken the project until now since it involved a lot of unfamiliar tech for me. Prior to this project I had never written in HTML or CSS, much less launched a website or dealt with hosting.
				</p>
				<p>
					I knew that this project would be time consuming and require a lot of learning, which is exactly why I finally decided to start on it during this winter break from university. After having finished my Data Structures & Algorithms class with a hard-earned 'A', and completing <a href="./KomiBot.html">another successful project</a> using previously unfamiliar technology, I was finally starting to feel confident in myself as a programmer, and ready to take on another new challenge.
				</p>
				<class class="section-title"> The <span>Beginning</span></class>
				<p>
					As with many new skills, my journey learning HTML & CSS began on YouTube. I started with a brief 3-hour guide which helped me create my portfolio website. I quickly picked up on the fundamentals of HTML & CSS as I copied down hundreds of lines, experimenting with incremental changes as I went. I gradually deviated from the guide's suggestions as I grew more comfortable with the languages, adding & removing elements to fit my needs, and completely redesigning parts of the site that I wasn't satisfied with. 
				</p>
				<class class="section-title">Making <span>progress</span></class>
				<p>
					Throughout the process of creating the site, I learned about web development practices I had never thought about before, such as 'mobile first design'. I became comfortable with basic CSS styling, and learned how to incorporate dynamic scaling into my site to ensure that everything would be legible and appropriately scaled for any device or screen size. Admittedly, it took me quite a bit of trial and error to successfully incorporate these features into my site - especially when deviating from the tutorial - but it got progressively easier for me to add new features and design elements as I continued learning.
				</p>
				<p>
					I eventually ended up with a portfolio website that I was very happy with. I had changed the colors, added expressive backgrounds to the cards, and redesigned the 'projects' section; I felt that I had made the site uniquely mine.
				</p>
				<class class="section-title"> But wait, there's <span>more</span>!</class>
				<p>
					After having (mostly) completed my portfolio website, I decided that I wanted to create something 'from scratch', to accompany the portfolio website & further distance it from its humble start in a YouTube tutorial video.
				</p>
				<p>
					Naturally, I chose to make a blog website. I could host the blog as a subdomain to the main portfolio website, and keep the styling consistent between the two sites. I would continue to implement new features unique to the blog site, allowing me to continue learning about HTML & CSS. I could later use those skills to further improve my portfolio website & incorporate the blog into my portfolio. But I had a lot of work ahead of me before then...
				</p>
				<class class="section-title">The <span>blog</span></class>
				<p>
					As I started on the blog, I had a few speed bumps. Throughout creating my portfolio website, I was only working with a single page. My blog website would need multiple pages, each comprising of more text & image content than my entire portfolio website. Luckily, after a bit of research I found that this wasn't a complicated problem to solve. Before long I had created my first post, and managed to incorporate images & a thumbnail for the 'recent posts' section on the blog's home page. After that, I could use the first post as a template for future posts, and create new content much more easily.
				</p>
				<class class="section-title">Anxious <span>perfectionism</span></class>
				<p>
					Despite my pride in the progress I had made with the blog website, I was unsatisfied with the efficiency of my programming. I had made numerous inefficient decisions to save time, such as copy+pasting the code for my header and footer section on every page, rather than loading them from some kind of global file to save on bandwidth and keep the site snappy. I wasn't sure how to do things like this, but I was sure that they were possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					I briefly tried to solve these issues of inefficiency, but after a brief failed attempt to optimize the above-mentioned header & footer code using JQuery, I decided that it wasn't worth the time to push for optimization, and continued development. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Perhaps this was an unnecessary concern for my small project, and my recently-completed Data Structures & Algorithms class had instilled in me an obsession with efficiency. Just a few weeks ago I was being tested on the time & space complexity of algorithms like Shell sort and Quicksort, and using dynamic programming methods like memoization to improve the efficiency of a recursive Fibonacci function. It may not have been necessary for me to approach web design with the same efficiency-focused perfectionism that was expected of me in my classes. But regardless, my inability to optimize my website left me feeling uneasy, and hesitant to list this site on my resume & portfolio.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the time being I'll have to forgive myself that my first 'from scratch' website is less than perfect, and hope that others do as well, as I continue learning.
				</p>
				<class class="section-title">A job well (ish) <span>done</span>.</class>
				<p>
					With all that said, I'm relatively happy with how my first (2-part) web design project turned out. I look forward to continuing to add to my blog & portfolio as I learn more about web design, and hope to use this platform to give those who are interested a look into my mind as a developer.
