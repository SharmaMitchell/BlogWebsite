# BlogWebsite
A blog website to host programming-related content, written by me. Work in progress.

This is my first fully original front-end project. Taking what I learned from the portfolio website I made & improved from a tutorial, I set out to make this website from scratch.
I've already encountered a number of challenges in the project: never having made a website with multiple pages being one of them.
However, I'm making an effort to learn as I go & continually improve upon this project as I continue learning about web development.

The website currently has a working 'Home' page to display recent posts, a short 'about me' section, and a link to my portfolio webiste. 
I also have a working first post, although I'm not quite happy with the page styling on it.

In an effort to keep styling consistent between my portfolio website and this blog, I've used the same header and footer from the portfolio website.
However I've slightly modified the header to reflect the content of the blog, and I've changed the main banner image of the site as well.

I have a number of planned improvements in mind, such as a nicer-looking 'recent posts' section for the home page, and better incorporation of images on post pages, but I'm not sure how much I'll be able to add before I get tied up with the upcoming Spring 2022 semester.
Until then, I plan to continue self-studying web development & design, and iterating upon this site.
